Essential Analytical Objectives
1. Delays by airline (carrier performance)
Why? Airlines differ in punctuality due to their operations and resource management. Comparing carriers helps identify systemic reliability issues.
2. Delays by airport (origin and destination)
Why? Some airports are more prone to delays because of congestion or weather. This highlights high-risk locations in the network.
3. Delays by route (origin–destination pairs)
Why? Certain city pairs consistently accumulate more delays; useful for planning and passenger advisories.
4. Delays by time of day, day of week, and season
Why? Flight delays follow strong temporal patterns (e.g., evenings and holiday peaks are riskier). This improves scheduling and forecasting.
5. Impact of weather conditions on delays
Why? Weather is one of the strongest predictors of delays, especially for severe disruptions. Including it is crucial for predictive accuracy.
6. Causes of delay (carrier, weather, ATC, late inbound aircraft, etc.)
Why? Understanding why flights are delayed supports targeted interventions and prevention strategies.
7. Delay duration categories (short vs. severe delays)
Why? Not all delays are equally impactful. Distinguishing between minor operational delays and long disruptions is critical for cost and customer satisfaction.
8. Probability of cancellation or diversion
Why? Predicting severe disruptions (not just delays) is essential for operational planning and passenger management.

These eight objectives cover the who (airline, airport, route), when (time/season), why (causes, weather), and how bad (duration, cancellations)—the essential dimensions needed for a solid predictive model.
